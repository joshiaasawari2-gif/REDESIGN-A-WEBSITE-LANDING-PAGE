Redesign a Website Landing Page
📌 Description

📌 Overview

This project is completed as part of the CODTECH Web Development Internship – Task 1, which focuses on enhancing UI/UX skills by redesigning an existing website landing page. The aim of this task is to analyze a real landing page, identify its design flaws, and create a cleaner, more modern, and more user-friendly version. This task emphasizes usability, aesthetic improvements, visual hierarchy, color psychology, and responsiveness.
A landing page is the first point of interaction between a user and a digital product. A well-designed landing page plays a crucial role in user engagement, readability, and conversion. For this reason, redesigning a landing page is an essential exercise in understanding user experience (UX) and visual design principles. This project demonstrates my ability to observe, evaluate, and transform an existing interface into an improved version using design thinking.
📝 Task Description
For Task-1, I selected an existing website landing page and carefully analyzed its structure, layout, visuals, typography, spacing, navigation, and color usage. After identifying the weak areas, I redesigned the landing page with the aim of:
Improving user experience (UX)
Enhancing the visual aesthetics
Increasing clarity and readability
Creating a modern, professional lok
Establishing clean visual hierarchy
Highlighting important sections clearly
Making the layout more intuitive fr usrs
The redesign focuses on improving both functionality and presentation, ensuring the page feels clean, easy to navigate, and visually appealing.

🎨 Redesign Approach
🔹 1. Layout Improvements
The original landing page had uneven spacing and alignment issues. In the redesign, I created a structured layout with consistent margins, padding, and grid alignment. This improves readability and gives the page a more polished look.
🔹 2. Typography
Typography plays a major role in user readability and overall design quality. I selected cleaner, modern fonts with proper line spacing. Heading sizes were adjusted to establish clear hierarchy, and body text was made more readable.
🔹 3. Color Scheme
The color palette was redesigned to be more modern and consistent. Colors were chosen based on psychology principles—highlight colors for CTAs, neutral shades for backgrounds, and soft contrasting colors for emphasis. This improves branding and user focus.
🔹 4. Improved User Flow
The redesigned layout guides the user naturally through the page—from the hero section to features, testimonials, and call-to-action buttons. Navigation was simplified, reducing confusion and making the page more intuitive.
🔹 5. Visual Hierarchy
Important information such as the main heading, CTA button, and key features were highlighted using size, color, and spacing. This helps users quickly understand the purpose of the page.
🔹 6. Imagery and Icons
High-quality images and consistent icons were used to replace unclear or outdated visuals. They help enhance the professional appeal and clarity of the page.
🔹 7. Responsiveness (Optional)
Although the core task is UI redesign, the layout was structured in a way that could easily be made fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
